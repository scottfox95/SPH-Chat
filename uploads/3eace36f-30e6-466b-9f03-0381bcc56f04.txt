In exercising its powers, the board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and to that end shall have all the powers of the director from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit, provided all requirements imposed by all applicable laws are met. The board may also remand any appeal for the receipt of additional information. 
(3)        In the case of a building, structure, or service system which, in the opinion of the building official, constitutes an unsafe condition as that term is used in section 7-63, the building official may, in the decision or order, limit the time for the filing of such appeals to not less than two days and the director may request expedited review by the board of the appeal.

(4)        The board shall grant variances from the provisions or requirements of this chapter only upon making written findings of the following:

c.        The grant of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or any improvements; 
d.        The liberal interpretation and strict application of the applicable provisions or requirements of this chapter would cause undue and unnecessary hardship; 
e.        The method or material requested is at least as protective as the method or materials required by this chapter; and
