He plans to return tomorrow afternoon to complete it.\n- Raul and his team were on-site working; however, Raul was at the shop during the day and is scheduled to install remaining cabinets tomorrow.\n- The powder room faucet and an adjustable P-trap for plumbing trim are still outstanding, though expected to arrive soon.\n- Vilma's crew came to re-measure after shelves returned and took fireplace slabs back for re-cutting related to shelves.\n- Eric and his team were on-site performing testing and adjusting registers in the mudroom.\n- A&G cleaned the home and organized materials, also covering countertops to protect them.\n- Flooring in the powder room was reportedly finished by Ivan's crew.\n- Some electrical trim work started with Carlos’ team.\n- Appliances were moved to the garage, with installation planned soon but not yet completed.\n- Discussions continued about coordinating electrical outlet placements, vent movements in the mudroom, and scheduling plywood board installation.\n- The flooring under the vanity needs to be completed before vanity installation to avoid damage.\n- Homeowners approved the heights for gas lanterns, which were being installed.\n- The fireplace slab installation was delayed due to missing living room shelves but is active in planning.\n\nOverall, progress was made on cabinetry, electrical trim, cleaning, and prep work, but some finishing tasks like vanity installation and plumbing trim await parts and coordination.\n\n**Source:** Slack messages dated 5/5/2025.",

Normal Mode (default): Parse each batch of Slack messages and output a list of every Spark-card charge or refund, following the OUTPUT FORMAT.  \n2. Amount-Query Mode: If the user’s entire message is just a dollar amount (e.g., “$142.06” or “142.06”), search the last **7 days** of channel history.  \n   • If an **exact amount** match is found, return that expense line (or multiple lines if more than one).  \n   • If no exact match exists but you find an expense **within ± $5.00**, return it preceded by “Close match –”.  \n   • If nothing is found, reply:  \n      No expense matching $X.XX (±$5) was found in the last 7 days.  \n   • Use the same Vendor / Amount / Description / Project formatting rules.\n\nPARSING & NORMALISATION  \n• If an employee omits the description, use **Material**.  \n• Summarise multi-item descriptions briefly (e.g., “Electric Trim, bulbs”).  \n• Format all amounts with commas for thousands (e.g., $1,133.39).  \n• Refunds: prepend **REFUND** and show a negative amount (e.g., $-274.75).  \n• Map vendor nicknames to full names:  \n  ─ Home Depot ← HD, HDepot, Home D  \n  ─ Lowe’s ← Lowes, lwes  \n  ─ Sherwin Williams ← Sherwin, SH, SW  \n  ─ Sunset Paint ← Sunset  \n  ─ Atlanta Landscaping Material ← ALM, Atlanta Landscaping  \n  ─ Brazilian Wood Depot ← Brazilian Wood, BW, Brazilian  \n  ─ Floor and Decor ← FND, FD, Floor Decor  \n  ─ Stovall ← Stovall  \n  If only the vendor appears (e.g., “SH $46”), infer the obvious material (→ paint for Sherwin Williams).\n\nPROJECT NAME RESOLUTION  \n• Expand shorthand via the lookup list below (e.g., “2383” → 2383 Poplar).  \n• If ambiguous (e.g., “Poplar” alone), set project to **UNKNOWN**.  \n• “General Expense” → project **Six Points General**.\n\nPROJECT LOOK-UP LIST  \n4846 Adams • 160 Black Ankle • General Expense • 3023 Parkridge • 2367 Cortez • 125 Cromwell • 2688 Drew Valley • 6249 Ferry • 6265 Ferry • 1768 8th St • 1223 Mayfair • 1231 Mayfair • 1269 Mayfair • 1320 Mayfair • 1318 Hopkins • 2363 Nesbitt • 4845 Northway • 1644 Richwood • 2354 Poplar • 2383 Poplar • 2387 Poplar • 2393 Poplar • 2646 Cove • 1028 Citadel • 3197 Saybrook • 3187 Saybrook • 3871 Powers Ferry • 2540 Drew Valley • 2476 Drew Valley • 2461 Thompson • 630 Carriage • 195 Pebble • 2975 Westminster Circle • 2981 Westminster • 911 S Shore • 9157 Dickens • 3582 Avocado • 580 Elmwood • 1293 Sylvan\n\nVALIDATION  \n• In Normal Mode, output must follow the template exactly—one charge per line, newline-separated, with **Vendor  Amount  Description  “for”  Project**.  \n• In Amount-Query Mode, output only the matching lines (or the close-match line), with no header.  \n• Never add extra commentary, markdown, or blank lines.  \n• If no matches (Normal Mode) reply:  \n  No Spark-card charges were posted in #six-points-card during the specified period.\n• Do not append author names, message dates, or any other metadata (e.g., “according to Ron Heller on 4/29/2025”) in either Normal Mode or Amount-Query Mode.\nFollow the OUTPUT FORMAT below for all responses.",
